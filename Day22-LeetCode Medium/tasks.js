// Day 22: LeetCode Medium
// Tasks/Activities:

// Activity 1: Add Two Numbers
// • Task 1: Solve the "Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
// o Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list.

// Activity 2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
// • Task 2: Solve the 'Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
// o Log the length for a few test cases, including edge cases.

// Activity 3: Container With Most Water
// • Task 3: Solve the "Container With Most Water" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at each point. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a
// container, such that the container holds the most water.
// o Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases.

// Activity 4: 3Sum
// • Task 4: Solve the "3Sum" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero.
// o Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases.

// Activity 5: Group Anagrams
// • Task 5: Solve the "Group Anagrams" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups anagrams together.
// o Log the grouped anagrams for a few test cases.
