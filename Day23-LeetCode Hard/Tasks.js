// Day 23: LeetCode Hard
// Tasks/Activities:

// Activity 1: Median of Two Sorted Arrays
// • Task 1: Solve the "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of integers and returns the median of the two sorted arrays.
// o Log the median for a few test cases, including edge cases.

// Activity 2: Merge k Sorted Lists
// • Task 2: Solve the "Merge k Sorted Lists" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes an array of k linked lists, each linked list is sorted in ascending order, and merges all the linked lists into one sorted linked list.
// o Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.

// Activity 3: Trapping Rain Water
// • Task 3: Solve the "Trapping Rain Water" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, and computes how much water it can trap after raining.
// o Log the amount of trapped water for a few test cases.

// Activity 4: N-Queens
// • Task 4: Solve the "N-Queens" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that places n queens on an nxn chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
// o Log the distinct solutions for a few test cases.

// Activity 5: Word Ladder
// • Task 5: Solve the "Word Ladder" problem on LeetCode.
// o Write a function that takes a begin word, an end word, and a dictionary of words, and finds the length of the shortest transformation sequence from the begin word to the end word,
// such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transformed word must exist in the word list.
// o Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.
